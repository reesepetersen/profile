    "Why is healthcare so expensive? Many Americans may ask this question when looking for health insurance or seeing medical bills. While the answer to this question is complex and multi-faceted, we can make some progress in addressing healthcare costs by finding out which common conditions cost the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific, we can ask the question \"In 2019, did Americans with the 5 most prevalent medical conditions spend significantly different amounts on average by condition?\". Since the types of complications and treatments associated with different medical conditions can vary significantly I expect that there will be significant differences in the average expenditure per person by condition. There are also other, related questions worth exploring like \"Which conditions do Americans spend the most on in total?\" and \"What conditions cost the most per person regardless of prevalence?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The answers to these questions may be useful to policy-makers and consumers of medical services, since it will help them know what conditions to prevent to save money. These results may also be useful to insurance providers both to save money and to create useful policies."

In this analysis we find that diabetes is significantly more expensive on average than the other 4 most commmon medical conditions in the US in 2019. This could be because diabetes is frequently associated with multiple problematic symptoms and requires a regular supply to insulin to treat.\n",

This bias is difficult to test for however, as medical conditions do not always fit neatly into discrete categories and asking doctors to verify reported medical conditions would be time-consuming and costly. It is even possible that doctor-verified conditions could introduce a different kind of bias.\n",
